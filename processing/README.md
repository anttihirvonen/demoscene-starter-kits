# Gettings started with Processing

These kits contain basecode to get you started on programming simple demos with [Processing](http://www.processing.org) (version 2). All of the kits use Minim (bundled with Processing) for playing music. Syncing with music is done either in code or by using [GNU Rocket](https://github.com/kusma/rocket), a tool made for syncing demoscene productions.

In addition to the barebone kits, some examples are provided.

## Available kits

These kits are barebone examples of how to start demo development. If you wan't a clean start for your demo, choose one of these. 

* **[Processing_Demobase](Processing_Demobase)**: Basecode for demo development without bells and whistles. 
* **Processing_Demobase_Moonlander**: Basecode for demo development with GNU Rocket and Moonlander. (coming up)

## Examples

* **[Processing_01_Basics](Processing_01_Basics)**: Shows you how to draw accelerated resolution-independent 2D-graphics by using Processing's API. If you're just starting out, you should use this as a base for your demo instead of one of the barebone kits.
* **[Processing_02_3D](Processing_02_3D)**: Example of how to draw 3D-graphics.

## TODO

- [ ] import basic-2d code from previous repository
- [ ] implement GNU Rocket integration in Processing
- [ ] code basic-3d -examples
- [ ] find and add more helpful links on this page
- [ ] give a quick rundown on Processing's core (how everything works)
